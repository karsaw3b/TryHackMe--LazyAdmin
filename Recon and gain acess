At first of course nmap scan which is giving us only 2 open ports, nothing interesting, there's only ssh and web server running on machine.
We also run a gobuster scan, its importan, even more than nmap because this attack is more geared towards exploring sensitive libraries which shoud not been public. 

From gobuster I know there is dir called content, which is kind a informing page from web aplication.
App is called "Sweetrice" and its CMS. This one is new to me, I don't have experience with it. I searched exploit for this ap but its only for older versions. 
"Content" dir has link for technical help for admins, many usefull informations about security which we can leverage, for example that every importan file is stored in inc dir.
I know content is dir because I noticed here is slash at the end so lets run gobuster again. It was good idea because we forced another dir called "as", which is login page.
