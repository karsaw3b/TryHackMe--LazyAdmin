At first of course nmap scan which is giving us only 2 open ports, nothing interesting, there's only ssh and web server running on machine.
We also run a gobuster scan, its importan, even more than nmap because this attack is more geared towards exploring sensitive libraries which shoud not been public. 

From gobuster I know there is dir called content, which is kind a informing page from web aplication. 
Ap is called Sweetrice. This one is new to me, I don't have experience with it. I searched exploit for this ap but for older versions. 
I know its dir because I noticed its slash at the end so lets run gobuster again. It was good idea
